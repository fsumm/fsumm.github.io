	    				<h1>Making Sense of Senseless Violence: An Interview with Jack Womack</h1>
                        <h4>By Brendan Byrne</h4>
                        <h4 id="article-source"><a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2011/dec/07/jack-womack/">rhizome.org</a></h4>

                        <p>This summer when Britain was gripped by civil disturbance, it was suggested by some in the SF community that if you wanted to understand the underlying psychology of those involved, you should read Jack Womack’s Random Acts of Senseless Violence, originally published in 1994. Random Acts details in diary form the tribulations of twelve-year-old Lola Hart as her New York City, family, and persona come apart. It also serves as an entry point for Womack’s six-book Dryco series, which presents post-disaster America as trailer-trash corporate dystopia, complete with Elvis worship, unchecked rape and murder, and its own argot. Recently I met with Womack and asked him about the creation and particular prescience of these novels.<p>

                        <hr class="divider">
                        <p class="lead-in">Your novels make me unbelievably anxious.</p>
                        <p class="answer">I relieve my own anxiety by writing them. So, yeah, it’s transference.
                        <p class="lead-in">One of the things that’s so anxiety-inducing about Random Acts, as well as your first novel Ambient, is that there’s always scarcity: there’s never enough money, never enough food, never enough security. Which seems to me extremely, though not exclusively, New York.</p>
                        <p>Oh, at the time it certainly was. The New York in Ambient was what I saw happening if everything had kept getting worse. When O’Malley is walking home to his apartment in the Lower East Side, that’s the way it used to be. What the predictive element missed was that New York would skyrocket back, and that neighborhoods you couldn’t go into at night thirty years ago, you now couldn’t afford. I moved up here in 1977 right after the blackout and the Son of Sam summer. So the fear definitely comes across. When you see Taxi Driver, that’s what it looked like. There’s no exaggeration. When you see any seventies movie, and you say, “I cannot believe how horrible New York looks,” that’s how it looked. You came up here because that was part of the charm. Unlike every other city that was falling apart and collapsing, New York still worked, but at the same time it was collapsing enough that you could come up here and live cheaply, and, y’know, thereby began the whole art scene from the ‘60s on. Because you had the space and opportunity.
                        <p class="lead-in">And that’s why you moved here.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">Were you in Kentucky at the time?</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">Wikipedia gives the copyright date for Random Acts as ‘95; my Grove Press edition says ‘93.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">So you were writing it in ‘92, ‘93</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">Spinning off from what you said about Ambient, Random Acts feels very much as if you took the early ‘90s and basically made everything get worse from right there.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">You said in a previous interview that you’d written Random Acts partially to show how the Dryco series argot came to be.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">We’re going to talk about prescience in a minute, but at the end of Random Acts, when she’s full on in the argot, it’s almost like the end of the bourgeoisie.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">And that whole universe isn’t going back either. Ambient doesn’t have a middle class. There’s the poor, the serving class, and the served.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">That’s still an accurate prediction. The particulars have shifted, but...</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">When I read the comments on Twitter about Random Acts being a good primer for understanding the mentality of the rioters in England, I didn’t particularly buy it at first.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">After some consideration, Random Acts does make very good required riot reading, in the sense that it’s a good way to understand the mentality of someone who’s ready to undertake that level of antisocial violence. </p>
                        <p class="lead-in">It’s something that the nice rich white family didn’t understand in ‘95, and they don’t understand it now. And, of course, Lola starts out as a nice rich white girl, although you can tell, even from the first line, that there’s something else in her.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">You think they’d teach it at Columbia in a gentrification course.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">What are some, if not inspirations, then possible precursors for Random Acts? People keep saying A Clockwork Orange, but the trajectory for Alex and Lola seems to be the opposite.</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">In an interview with Paul McAuley you said you came to SF from the “outside in.”</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">Do you read much SF now? You started not reading much...</p>
                        <p class="lead-in">Your new novel, Ashland, which you’re still working on, isn’t SF.</p>
